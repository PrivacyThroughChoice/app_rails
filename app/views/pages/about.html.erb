    <h2>What is <%= site_name %>?</h2>
    <p><%= site_name %> is a community-driven project that aims to bring transparency to the privacy and security of online services.</p>
    <p>New web applications, site and services go live everyday, and more of our lives is being put online. New companies barely a few months old are suddenly entrusted with your personal data. Long established services may have a history of privacy breaches or unsatisfactory behaviour with regards to safeguarding your personal data.</p>
    <p><%= site_name %> is a way to bring this information together to allow you to make an informed choice on whether to use a service, or which of several competing services to use. Most services are happy to shout about their amazing features and this site aims to bridge the gap between the marketing material and reality.</p>
